Example  : Consider we are designing a enemy ship shooting game in which enemy ships are
generated randomly on the screen. So :

What is Factory pattern?

1)When a method returns one of several possile classes that shaRE A COMMON SUPER CLASS
>create a new nemy in a game
>random number gnerator picks a numbe assigned to a specific enemy
>the factory return the enemy associated with that number
2)The class is chosen at run time.

So,
When to use a factory pattern ?
>when you want to hide the object creation from user.
>when you dont know ahead of time what class object you need
>when all of the potential classes are in the same subclass hierarchy
>to centralize class selction code
>when tou don't want the user to know every subclass.
>to encapsulate object creation
