Abstract Class :

Act as an boundary between implemenatation method and its functionality.
It is used to exchange the functionality between the concrete class members and abstract classs methods.

Why we need ?
1) Default Functionality for all classes.
2) Template
3) Code re-usability
4) Separate method definition
5) Loose coupling
6) Dynamic method resolution.

Rules
1) It cannot b instantiated
2) It can have final methods
3) Declared using abstract keyword
4) It can have abstract and non abstract methods.
5) It can have constructors and static methods.

Achieve Abstraction
1) Implementing an Abstract class
2) Implementing an interface

Difference Abstract and Interface
1) Abstract class has static, non static, final, non final variables.
   Interface has Static and final variables only.
2) Abstract class can implement an interface.
   Interface will not implement the Abstract class.
3) Abstract class can extends Java Classes and Interfaces
   Interface can extend only an Interface.
4) Members can be Private and Protected in an abstract class.
   Members are Public by default in an Interface.
