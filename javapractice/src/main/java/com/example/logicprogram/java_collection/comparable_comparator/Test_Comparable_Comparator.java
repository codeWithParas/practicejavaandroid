        /*
        * Why we use comparator ? In which scenerio we go with comparator() interface ?
        *
        * Ans : Please Understand Clearly
        * Consider two bussiness logic case first -> A & Second -> B
        * Since we do our sorting with comparable also but we can use camparator also..Y ?..lets suppose
        * In our one of model class (in project) we have lots of data. At the time of development we need to sort
        * this data to satisfy any bussiness logic(A). So inside our model class we can implement comparable interface
        * and override compareTo() method , inside compareTo() method we can give our sorting algo. And overall after
        * completion of project we call this sorting as default sorting which will be mendatory case.
        *     Now suppose after some days we need to make an update in list of data that we have sorted before to
        *     satisfy second bussiness logic i.e B. So to do this updation without touching (effecting) previous
        *     implementation we will add-one B bussiness logic with A bussiness logic. So to do dis we can use
        *     comparator interface. Comparator interface will make use of previous model class (which is
        *     implementing comparable interface already by default) only we need to provide another sorting method
        *     i.e compare() method and inside compare method we will execute second bussiness logic "B". So we call
        *     this implementation as custom sorting.(we called this "Custom sorting" becouse we considering
        *     first-level-sorting(comaparable) as default which is used by comparator sorting method.)
        *
        *
        * Note**: If we use both sorting together (comparable and comparator) for one model class. Then we use term
        * -----> *for comparable interface as default sorting technique. And
        * -----> *for comparator interface as custom sorting technique.
        *
        * Hence ,
        * Comparator Interface : When We want our custom sorting over default sorting.
        *                       Then we should go with Comparator Interface
        *

        *
