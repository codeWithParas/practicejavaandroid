Big-O : Big Order

1) O of 1 "O(1)" indicates there is one step regards of number of data element.
2) O of N "O(N)" indicates there is one step for each data element.
3) What about binary search where number of steps increases at a rate different than data element?
Neither O(1) or O(N) is sufficient. So we have O(logN) used to describe binary searches.
