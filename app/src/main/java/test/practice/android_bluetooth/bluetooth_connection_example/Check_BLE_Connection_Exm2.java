        * Connecting Devices
        *
        * To initiate a connection with a Bluetooth device, all that's needed from the associated BluetoothDevice object
        * is the MAC address, which you retrieve by calling getAddress().
        * Caution: Performing device discovery consumes a lot of the Bluetooth adapter's resources. After you have found a
        * device to connect to, be certain that you stop discovery with cancelDiscovery() before attempting a connection.
        * Also, you shouldn't perform discovery while connected to a device because the discovery process significantly
        * reduces the bandwidth available for any existing connections.
        *
        * 1) In order to create a connection between two devices, you must implement both the server-side and client-side
        * mechanisms because one device must open a server socket, and the other one must initiate the connection using the
        * server device's MAC address.
        *
        * 2) The server device and the client device each obtain the required BluetoothSocket in different ways. The server
        * receives socket information when an incoming connection is accepted. The client provides socket information when it
        * opens an RFCOMM channel to the server.
        *
        *
        * Connection techniques :
        *
        * One implementation technique is to automatically prepare each device as a server so that each device has a
        * server socket open and listening for connections. In this case, either device can initiate a connection with the
        * other and become the client. Alternatively, one device can explicitly host the connection and open a server socket
        * on demand, and the other device initiates the connection.
        *
        * Note: If the two devices have not been previously paired, then the Android framework automatically shows a pairing
        * request notification or dialog to the user during the connection procedure.
        *
        *
        * */

        /*
        * A) Connecting as a server :
        *
        * When you want to connect two devices, one must act as a server by holding an open BluetoothServerSocket.
        * The purpose of the server socket is to listen for incoming connection requests and provide a connected BluetoothSocket
        * after a request is accepted. When the BluetoothSocket is acquired from the BluetoothServerSocket, the BluetoothServerSocket
        * can—and should—be discarded, unless you want the device to accept more connections.
        *
        * To set up a server socket and accept a connection, complete the following sequence of steps:
        *
        * 1) Get a BluetoothServerSocket by calling listenUsingRfcommWithServiceRecord().
        * The string is an identifiable name of your service, which the system automatically writes to a new Service Discovery
        * Protocol (SDP) database entry on the device. The name is arbitrary and can simply be your application name.
        * The UUID is also included in the SDP entry and forms the basis for the connection agreement with the client device.
        * That is, when the client attempts to connect with this device, it carries a UUID that uniquely identifies the service
        * with which it wants to connect. These UUIDs must match in order for the connection to be accepted.
        *
        * 2) Start listening for connection requests by calling accept().
        * This is a blocking call. It returns when either a connection has been accepted or an exception has occurred. A
        * connection is accepted only when a remote device has sent a connection request containing a UUID that matches
        * the one registered with this listening server socket. When successful, accept() returns a connected BluetoothSocket.
        *
        * 3) Unless you want to accept additional connections, call close().
        * This method call releases the server socket and all its resources, but doesn't close the connected BluetoothSocket
        * that's been returned by accept(). Unlike TCP/IP, RFCOMM allows only one connected client per channel at a time, so
        * in most cases, it makes sense to call close() on the BluetoothServerSocket immediately after accepting a connected socket.
        *
        * Because the accept() call is a blocking call, it should not be executed in the main activity UI thread so that your
        * application can still respond to other user interactions. It usually makes sense to do all work that involves a
        * BluetoothServerSocket or BluetoothSocket in a new thread managed by your application. To abort a blocked call such
        * as accept(), call close() on the BluetoothServerSocket or BluetoothSocket from another thread. Note that all methods
        * on a BluetoothServerSocket or BluetoothSocket are thread-safe.
        *
        * About UUID
        * A Universally Unique Identifier (UUID) is a standardized 128-bit format for a string ID used to uniquely identify
        * information. The point of a UUID is that it's big enough that you can select any random ID and it won't clash with
        * any other ID. In this case, it's used to uniquely identify your application's Bluetooth service. To get a UUID to
        * use with your application, you can use one of the many random UUID generators on the web, then initialize a UUID
        * with fromString(String).

        * a) Using the BluetoothAdapter, you can find remote Bluetooth devices either through device discovery or by querying
        * the list of paired devices.
        * b) Device discovery is a scanning procedure that searches the local area for Bluetooth-enabled devices.
        * and requests some information about each one.
        * c) However, a nearby Bluetooth device responds to a discovery request only if it is currently accepting information
        * requests by being discoverable.
        * d) If a device is discoverable, it responds to the discovery request by sharing some information, such as the device's
        * name, its class, and its unique MAC address.
        * e) Using this information, the device that is performing the discovery process can then choose to initiate a connection
        * to the discovered device.
        * f) Once a connection is made with a remote device for the first time, a pairing request is automatically presented
        * to the user. When a device is paired, the basic information about that device—such as the device's name, class, and
        * MAC address—is saved and can be read using the Bluetooth APIs.
        * g) Using the known MAC address for a remote device, a connection can be initiated with it at any time without performing
        * discovery, assuming the device is still within range.
        *
        * Note that there is a difference between being paired and being connected:
        * 1) To be paired means that two devices are aware of each other's existence, have a shared link-key that can be used for
        * authentication, and are capable of establishing an encrypted connection with each other.
        * 2) To be connected means that the devices currently share an RFCOMM channel and are able to transmit data with each other.
        * The current Android Bluetooth API's require devices to be paired before an RFCOMM connection can be established.
        * Pairing is automatically performed when you initiate an encrypted connection with the Bluetooth APIs.
