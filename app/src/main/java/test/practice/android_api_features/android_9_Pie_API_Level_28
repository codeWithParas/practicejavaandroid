   NNAPI is meant to be called by machine learning libraries, frameworks, and tools that let developers
   train their models off-device and deploy them on Android devices. Apps typically would not use NNAPI
   directly, but would instead use higher-level machine learning frameworks. These frameworks in turn
   could use NNAPI to perform hardware-accelerated inference operations on supported devices.
