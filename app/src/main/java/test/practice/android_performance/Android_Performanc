TO maintain performance through following ways :

1) Use Fragments.
2) Use foreach loop as much as possible . (w.r.t JIT compiler : Good if JIT not available also).
3) Use lint
4) Use of Proguard
5) Don't use Static variables. That may create strong reference after activity destroyed.
6) Use parcelable interface for marshalling and un-marshalling the object.

Android 9 brings the following text-related features to the platform:
7) Precomputed Text: The PrecomputedText class improves text-rendering performance by enabling
   you to compute and cache the required information ahead of time.
   It also enables your app to perform text layout off the main thread.
8) Magnifier: The Magnifier class is a platform widget that provides a magnifier API,
   allowing for a consistent magnifier-feature experience across all apps.
9) Smart Linkify: Android 9 enhances the TextClassifier class, which leverages machine
   learning to identify some entities in selected text and suggest actions. For example,
   TextClassifier can enable your app to detect that the user has selected a phone number.
   Your app could then suggest that the user make a phone call using that number. The features
   in TextClassifier replace the functionality of the Linkify class.
