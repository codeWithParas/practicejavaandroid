/**
 * Kotlin provides the ability to extend a class with new functionality without having to inherit from the class
 * or use design patterns such as Decorator. This is done via special declarations called extensions.
 *
 * For example, you can write new functions for a class from a third-party library that you can't modify.
 * Such functions can be called in the usual way, as if they were methods of the original class.
 * This mechanism is called an extension function. There are also extension properties that let you define new properties
 * for existing classes.
